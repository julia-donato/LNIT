# Linking a Network of Indiana Technologies

## Project Overview

### Goal & Impact
In collaboration with AnalytiXIN, this project aims to collect, analyze, and visualize data on clinical trials in Indiana, focusing on equitable access across the state. It involves a comparative analysis of Indiana's clinical trials against national data, categorization by county for regional distribution, development of data visualization tools, and providing insights and recommendations.

### Key Findings
- Indiana ranks 38th nationally per capita in clinical trials.
- A significant portion (64%) of trials in Indiana are industry-funded.
- In-depth analysis of "Other" funders with ties to Indiana, including major health institutions.
- A distinct urban-rural gap in clinical trials' locations, with a need for broader representation in rural areas.

### Methodology and Data Sources
- Data sourced from Clinicaltrials.gov, U.S. Census, and CMS.
- In-depth analysis using datasets like `uszips.csv`, `zips-by-county-2021.csv`, and `clinical_trial_int.csv`.
- Tools: Clinical_trial_IN_1208 Jupyter Notebook for data processing and visualization.

### Conclusions and Recommendations
Indiana's potential for increased clinical trial participation lies in enhancing accessibility for multi-institution trials and leveraging the state's strong life sciences sector. Recommendations include improving access for Hoosier trial participants and targeting more rural locations.
